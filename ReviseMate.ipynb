        "ReviseMate is an end-to-end system that produces questions and answers based on input text or document. The perfect use case is for students during the examination week. They provide a document of a certain topic and test their knowledge against the questions produced by the system. It includes a simple and neat interface to answer the quiz, built using Streamlit. The models are tested against reference answers produced by a Gemini-pro which is a Large Language Model. The testing framework for different types of questions are custom built. They quantify the correctness of the answers produced by the models, and the best performing Small Language model is Mistral-7B.\n",
        "Note: All the models are quantized to adjust to the memory constraints."

        "- If the quatization/calibration dataset for the gptq model is different from our intended usecase, then the gguf model will most likely give better performance than the GPTQ model. Because using the calibration dataset, the length of weights(fp-16, fp-8) of the model are decided.\n",
        "- Sometimes GPTQ models act funny like giving responses to simple prompts but not slightly complex ones.\n",
        "- Q4_K_M provides the best and most stable results among all the quantized Mistral models including the Q5_K_M which is supposedly the most effective and efficient.\n",

His mother, Ann Dunha m (1942–1995) , was born in Wichita,\\nKansas and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-\\ngreat-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in\\n1850.[11] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunha m was descended from John\\nPunch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[12][13]\\nObama\\'s father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–19 82),[14][15] was a married[16][17][18] Luo Kenyan from\\nNyang\\'oma Kogelo.[16][19] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[20] Obama\\'s parents\\n0:000:00\\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\\nEarly life and careerObama (right) with grandfather\\nStanley Armour Dunham, mother Ann\\nDunham, and half-sister Maya\\nSoetoro, mid-1970s in Honolulumet in 1960 in a Russian langua ge class at the University of\\nHawai ʻ i at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a\\nscholarship.[21][22] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on\\nFebruary 2, 1961, s ix months before Obama was born.[23][24]\\nIn late August 1961,  a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his\\nmother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where\\nthey lived for a year. During that time, Barack\\'s father completed\\nhis unde rgraduate degree in econom ics in Hawaii, graduating in\\nJune 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at\\nHarvard University, where he earned an M.A. in econom ics.\\nObama\\'s parents divorced in March 1964.[25] Obama Sr. returned\\nto Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for\\nthe Kenyan gove rnment as the Senior Econom ic Analyst in the\\nMinistry of Finance.[26] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[27] before he was killed\\nin an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[28] Recalling his early childhood,\\nObama said: \"That my father looke d nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my\\nmother white as milk—ba rely registered in my mind.\"[22] He described his struggles as a young adult to\\nreconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[29]\\nIn 1963, Dunha m met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indone sian East–West Center\\ngraduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[30] After two one-year\\nextensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indone sia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen\\nmonths later in 1967 . The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighbor hood in the Tebet district of\\nSouth Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighbor hood in the Menteng district of Central\\nJakarta.[31]\\nAt the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indone sia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten,\\nhe was registered in school as \"Barry\"[32] and attended local Indone sian-langua ge schools: Sekolah Dasar\\nKatolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and\\nSekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years,\\nsupplemented by English-langua ge Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[33][34] As a result of his\\nfour years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indone sian fluently as a child.[35] During his time in Indone sia,\\nObama\\'s stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the\\nworld works\".[36]\\nIn 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandpa rents, Madelyn and Stanley\\nDunha m. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a\\nscholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[37] In high school, Obama\\ncontinued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[38] Obama\\nlived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his\\nmother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[39] Obama chose to stay in\\nHawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indone sia in 1975, so his mother could begin\\nanthropology field work.[40] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indone sia, divorcing Lolo\\nSoetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful\\ntreatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[41]EducationObama\\'s Indonesian school record in\\nSt. Francis of Assisi Catholic\\nElementary School.

His mother, Ann Dunha m (1942–1995) , was born in Wichita,\\nKansas and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-\\ngreat-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in\\n1850.[11] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunha m was descended from John\\nPunch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[12][13]\\nObama\\'s father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–19 82),[14][15] was a married[16][17][18] Luo Kenyan from\\nNyang\\'oma Kogelo.[16][19] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[20] Obama\\'s parents\\n0:000:00\\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\\nEarly life and careerObama (right) with grandfather\\nStanley Armour Dunham, mother Ann\\nDunham, and half-sister Maya\\nSoetoro, mid-1970s in Honolulumet in 1960 in a Russian langua ge class at the University of\\nHawai ʻ i at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a\\nscholarship.[21][22] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on\\nFebruary 2, 1961, s ix months before Obama was born.[23][24]\\nIn late August 1961,  a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his\\nmother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where\\nthey lived for a year. During that time, Barack\\'s father completed\\nhis unde rgraduate degree in econom ics in Hawaii, graduating in\\nJune 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at\\nHarvard University, where he earned an M.A. in econom ics.\\nObama\\'s parents divorced in March 1964.[25] Obama Sr. returned\\nto Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for\\nthe Kenyan gove rnment as the Senior Econom ic Analyst in the\\nMinistry of Finance.[26] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[27] before he was killed\\nin an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[28] Recalling his early childhood,\\nObama said: \"That my father looke d nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my\\nmother white as milk—ba rely registered in my mind.\"[22] He described his struggles as a young adult to\\nreconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[29]\\nIn 1963, Dunha m met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indone sian East–West Center\\ngraduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[30] After two one-year\\nextensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indone sia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen\\nmonths later in 1967 . The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighbor hood in the Tebet district of\\nSouth Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighbor hood in the Menteng district of Central\\nJakarta.[31]\\nAt the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indone sia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten,\\nhe was registered in school as \"Barry\"[32] and attended local Indone sian-langua ge schools: Sekolah Dasar\\nKatolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and\\nSekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years,\\nsupplemented by English-langua ge Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[33][34] As a result of his\\nfour years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indone sian fluently as a child.[35] During his time in Indone sia,\\nObama\\'s stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the\\nworld works\".[36]\\nIn 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandpa rents, Madelyn and Stanley\\nDunha m. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a\\nscholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[37] In high school, Obama\\ncontinued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[38] Obama\\nlived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his\\nmother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[39] Obama chose to stay in\\nHawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indone sia in 1975, so his mother could begin\\nanthropology field work.[40] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indone sia, divorcing Lolo\\nSoetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful\\ntreatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[41]EducationObama\\'s Indonesian school record in\\nSt. Francis of Assisi Catholic\\nElementary School.
